# Synched-Drawing-Swift

This is a Synchronized Drawing App using Firebase and Swift 3.0. 
The project allows all users who have this app to share theirr drawings in real time. By real time I mean while I am drawing a line on my screen the information on their screen would be updated. 

##Installing
Just download the zip file or desktop version from the big green button you see above in the top right of this repository that says Clone or Download.

##Things to Improve
* Add a login screen that allows for a one time login.
* Create drawing rooms so not everyone shares the same drawing space
* Include chat functionality with the drawing rooms
* Add a timer to upload images to Firebase and download those images instead of drawing all the points from scratch on start-up of the app.
* Add options for colors and drawing size and erasing (drawing in white)
* Maybe add different backgrounds? Like choosing a different color background or choosing an image as a background?

###Note
Ignore the name of the file. This project was originally meant to be include chat functionality which I have currently not gotten around to doing.
